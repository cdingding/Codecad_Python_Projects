# ESC+H : terminal commands
* The Jupyter Notebook has two different keyboard input modes. Edit mode allows you to type code/text into a cell and is indicated by a green cell border. Command mode binds the keyboard to notebook level actions and is indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin.
* In the new IPython cells could have two states: when it has a green selection rectangle around it you can edit what's inside; when it has a grey rectangle around it you edit the cell itself (copy/paste/delete). Enter/Return makes it go green, Esc makes it go grey. When it is gray, 'dd' will delete it.

# Lambda Functions:

Lambda to define unnamed functions to customize sort and use functions like map, filter and reduce.
Remember, a lambda expression looks like this:
**lambda variable: variable expression**


```python
L = [(2, 4), (5, 3), (6, 8), (4, 1)]
sorted(L)
```




    [(2, 4), (4, 1), (5, 3), (6, 8)]




```python
L.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
```

**All things you can do with list comprehensions you can also do with map.** It's more "Pythonic" to use list comprehensions, but understanding how to write maps is key for **numpy and pandas**, modules we will be using heavily.


```python
# Double every element of a list
def double_list(L):
    return map(lambda x: x * 2, L)
double_list(L)
```




    [(2, 4, 2, 4), (5, 3, 5, 3), (6, 8, 6, 8), (4, 1, 4, 1)]




```python
garbled = "IXXX aXXmX aXXXnXoXXXXXtXhXeXXXXrX sXXXXeXcXXXrXeXt mXXeXsXXXsXaXXXXXXgXeX!XX"
message = filter(lambda x: x!="X", garbled)
print message
```

    I am another secret message!



```python
#number 1 to 10 means including 10, so range(1,11)
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1,11)]
print squares
print filter(lambda x: x>=30 and x<=70, squares)
```

    [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
    [36, 49, 64]


Lambdas are useful when you need a quick function to do some work for you.
If you plan on creating a function you'll use over and over, you're better off using def and giving that function a name.


```python
languages = ["HTML", "JavaScript", "Python", "Ruby"]
print filter(lambda x: x=="Python", languages)
```

    ['Python']


Only we don't need to actually give the function a name; it does its work and returns a value without one. That's why the function the lambda creates is an anonymous function.
When we **pass the lambda to filter, filter uses the lambda to determine what to filter**, and the second argument (my_list, which is just the numbers 0 â€“ 15) is the list it does the filtering on.


```python
my_list = range(16)
print filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, my_list)
```

    [0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15]


# String and indices 


```python
#Stride
str = "ABCDEFGHIJ"
start, end, stride = 1, 6, 2
str[start:end:stride]
```




    'BDF'




```python
# Reverse
garbled = "!XeXgXaXsXsXeXmX XtXeXrXcXeXsX XeXhXtX XmXaX XI"
message=garbled[::-1]
print message
message=message[::2] #Save it back after slicing the string.
print message
```

    IX XaXmX XtXhXeX XsXeXcXrXeXtX XmXeXsXsXaXgXeX!
    I am the secret message!



```python
letters = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
print letters[::-1]
```

    ['E', 'D', 'C', 'B', 'A']



```python
# The default starting index is 0.
# The default ending index is the end of the list.
# The default stride is 1.
# Omit Indices
to_five = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'] 
print to_five[3:] # prints ['D', 'E'] 
print to_five[:2] # prints ['A', 'B'] 
print to_five[::2] # print ['A', 'C', 'E']
```

    ['D', 'E']
    ['A', 'B']
    ['A', 'C', 'E']



```python

```
